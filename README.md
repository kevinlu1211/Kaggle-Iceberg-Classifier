# Kaggle-Iceberg-Classifier

### Things to do:
* Try transfer learning using ResNet/VGG/DenseNet
* Read and understand the incidence angle and see if we can incorporate some prior information before feeding it to network
* Do some feature engineering in notebook:
    * ~~Use Sobel Kernels~~
    * ~~Use 2nd derivative~~
    * ~~Use magnitude of image~~
    * ~~Use Laplacian of the image~~
    * ~~Use Gabor filters~~
* Integrate the features into CNNs
* Do some image transformations using TorchVision
* Standardize image
