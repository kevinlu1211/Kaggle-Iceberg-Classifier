# Kaggle-Iceberg-Classifier

### Things to do:
* Try transfer learning using ResNet/VGG/DenseNet
* Read and understand the incidence angle and see if we can incorporate some prior information before feeding it to network
* Do some EDA, and understand the characteristics of the image. Maybe use some Gaussian kernels to reduce noise?
